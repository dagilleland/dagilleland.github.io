# Try, Try Again

I'm really not sure what it is: perfectionism, laziness, my personality type (ISFP, alternate ISFJ), life stage (parent of a pre-teen), age (let's not go there right now), being spread too thin (read "fragmentation"), too much work, etc. Probably a combination, but I find that I don't blog much, though I've got a spot for it in the vast ocean of the Internet. Also, I know I won't really get many readers (mostly my students, if they are bored enough to click a link to this site), so that's a de-motivator (though many writers are motivated by the # of readers, but by writing - maybe that's it).

In any case, here I am, trying to re-kick-start my personal blog. I do know that I can be picky about my tech choices in blogging (read the S & P in "ISFP"), and I've been looking for something with an ease-of-use and low maintainability index. But, I suppose if someone is going to blog, they are doing maintenance every time they blog.

Nonetheless[^1], here I am blogging. Again. And this time[^2] I'm using Jekyll and my GitHub account to host my pages. I'm going the lazy-man route, taking a made-for-github theme that I can just copy/paste to apply a look & feel without much re-work[^3]. Maybe this time I'll actually get something posted. Maybe....

1. Love that word :+1:
2. Uh-oh. A new blog site?! sigh. Now what to do about migrating my old posts that I still want to keep.... You think hording stuff in your garage is bad, you should see my hard drive(s).... (or not)
3. In the voice of Dr. McCoy: "****-it Jim, I'm a coder, not a designer!"
