# Understandable Church Hopping

Why do Christians change churches, even denominations?

- Sometimes it's because they are looking for a more bible-centric teaching (maybe Baptists?).
- Sometimes it's because they are looking for a more vibrant or spiritual experience in their daily lives (perhaps the Pentecostals?).
- Sometimes it's because they are looking for a sense of reverent worship or beauty (I'm thinking Anglican or Lutheran liturgy).
- Sometimes it's because they are looking for a deep and global sense of identity (Catholic or Greek Orthodox).
- Sometimes it's because they are looking for that sense of mission (Missionary Alliance or Salvation Army).

In each case, however, I think the true followers of Jesus are simply wanting a more **authentic** walk with God and His family.
