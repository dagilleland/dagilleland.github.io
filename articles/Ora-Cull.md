## Ora-Cull


Not being an Oracle expert (by any stretch of the imagination), I rely heavily on Google & other sites to figure out what's not working. Now understand, I don't even use Oracle that much - so when I run into an error, I need to find out what it means easily.



One place that is good to look at is [dbmotive's oracle error lookup page](http://www.dbmotive.com/oracle_error_codes.php). Another is [ora-code](http://ora-code.com/) (though it's descriptions are usually briefer than dbmotive's).
