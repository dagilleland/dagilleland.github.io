## A Holy Experience (.com)


[![www.aHolyExperience.com](images/2009/WLW-AHolyExperience.com_12EBC-image_3.png "www.aHolyExperience.com")](http://www.aholyexperience.com/)My wife pointed me to this site. It’s basically a blog, but what I find refreshing about it, besides the clear Christian messages with great reflections (& photos), is the music.



You seldom come across sites, particularly blogs, that have streaming background music. Most that do use music or sounds that’s just plain tacky. This site is different. It’s music is soothing, and that’s a good fit for the content as well.



So, go over there. Sit a spell, and let the music, the images, and the words wash over you. Let yourself be refreshed. I’m sure you’ll want to come back again and again.
