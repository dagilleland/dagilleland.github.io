## Up and Running!


Well!



After having played around non-committally with blogs on 3rd-party blog hosting sites, and finally getting around to installing the latest blog module (v. 3.02.00 in DNN 4.3.4) on my own site ([www.Gilleland.info](http://www.Gilleland.info)), I'm officially inaugurating it all with this posting.



I'm also doing some re-design of my personal website. I thought I would try for a "Google"-like look, just for fun, but who knows what the final permanent skin will be....



Also, with my new site comes some plans on what I'll be using it for (again, who knows what the finished product will be):


- Since I teach at NAIT ([www.nait.ca](http://www.nait.ca)) in the CST program ([http://cst.nait.ca](http://cst.nait.ca)), I am wanting to make notes & thoughts available to my students on my instructor website. I also have other postings and articles that I want to do that have nothing to do with my job (but which might still be of interest to my students). Hence, the idea to make my personal website a place where I can post blogs and articles on a wide, wide variety of topics. We'll se how successful I'm at in all of this. ;)
- While I'm at it, I thought I might get around to doing some general [biography info on myself](http://www.gilleland.info/AboutMe/tabid/687/Default.aspx) (maybe with a resume in the future).



At present, there's not much on this site, but that can (hopefully) change in the future! Stay tuned!!!
