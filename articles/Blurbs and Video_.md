## Blurbs and Video...


I ran into two cool sites today: [http://www.blurb.com/](http://www.blurb.com/) and [www.on2.com](http://www.on2.com)



The first allows a way to get your book printed (from 1 to x copies) at very good prices. The other is a company that promises a better video codec to improve download speed.
