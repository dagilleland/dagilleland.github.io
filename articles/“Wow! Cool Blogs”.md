![image](images/2009/WLW-WowCoolBlogs_BC0-image_3.png)Thank you! Thank you!



I know, you think my blogs are cool. But what’s way cool about them is not just that they got ***<font color="#8000ff">fancy images</font>*** and are so ***<font color="#ff8000">professional and well-written</font>***. What’s cool is that I write it all off-line, using Windows Live Writer (WLW), and then post it up when I’m satisfied with it. I use it for any blog I want: **<u>SharePoint</u>**, WordPress, [DotNetNuke](http://www.DotNetNuke.com) portals, whatever!



I can also edit previous blogs with WLW, and since WLW can run on my USB drive, I can write this from anywhere I want! There’s a whole suite of other features available via WLW plug-ins, including doing

- Polaroid-style pictures,
- Maps from Virtual Earth,
- Video inserts,
- Amazon Links (for those books you like – don’t forget your referral id!),
- and much, much more!
