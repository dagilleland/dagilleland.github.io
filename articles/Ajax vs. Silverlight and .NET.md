# Ajax vs. Silverlight and .NET
Nikhil Kothari makes some good observations regarding the spectrum of technologies available to developers in his blog "Ajax vs. Silverlight and .NET". He places the different technologies (& their popular combinations) on an axis that has Broader Reach on one end (meaning that they target browsers without much demand for specific client-side software other than what the browser itself has) and Greater Capabilities on the other (where these capabilities are supported by more client-side software beyond &/or integrated into the browser).  Overall, it's a great intro to where the technologies fit on the spectrum. Thanks Nikhil!
