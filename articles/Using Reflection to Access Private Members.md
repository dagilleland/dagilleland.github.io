## Using Reflection to Access Private Members
This [blog](http://www.jroller.com/page/CoBraLorD/20040901) by Arne Vandamme is a good intro to how you can use Reflection in .NET and Java to access private members of classes. This blog was a "break-through" article for me in my beginnings with TDD, as I was wrestling with a way to build tests for students' labs.
