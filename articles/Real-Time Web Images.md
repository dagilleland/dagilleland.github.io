## Real-Time Web Images


Here's an article on [building real-time web images](http://www.ftponline.com/vsm/2004_08/magazine/features/rjennings/) in VS. Also, there's a great [3rd party tool from NeoDynamic](http://www.neodynamic.com/ND/FaqsTipsTricks.aspx?tabid=66&amp;prodid=0&amp;sid=45) for combining images & adding effects for these images on your web page. Cool stuff!



There's also a book called the ASP.NET Cookbook, by O'Rielly, that has [a chapter on creating/altering images](http://downloads.techrepublic.com.com/download.aspx?docid=171992) for the web.
