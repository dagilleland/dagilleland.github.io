# C# and VB.Net Tutorials by Mike Kitchen


If you’re looking for a good tutorial to learn C# or VB.Net, then I would recommend the writings of a fellow in the UK by the name of **Mike Kitchen**. He has a website called [PublicJoe](http://www.publicjoe.co.uk/) that is chock full of good reading material. The [C# tutorial](http://www.publicjoe.co.uk/csharp/tut/tut.html) looks quite extensive, and the [VB.Net tutorial](http://www.publicjoe.co.uk/vbnet/tut/tut.html) looks pretty good too.

I’ve been impressed with the amount he has written in his tutorials, but it seems a bit difficult to learn more about him or find out how to contact him (other than his hotmail account). Hopefully I can get in touch with him someday – I want to see if he’s turned his online tutorials into a book. ***<u><font color="#004000">Mike</font></u>***: If you’re out there reading this, then drop me a line at *dgilleland[AT]Nait.ca*.
