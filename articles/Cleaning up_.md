# Cleaning up...

## Cleaning up...
Early in the morning, and I'm spending a few minutes cleaning up my site's articles and blogs. Specifically, I've moved some items from my Articles page into my Blogs page, because they were largely just references to articles written by others. Not that it matters to anyone, at this point, 'cause I don't have any "readership" as of yet, but at least you know where it's moved to....
