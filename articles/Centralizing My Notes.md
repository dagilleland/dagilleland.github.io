## Centralizing My Notes


For quite a while now, I’ve wanted to have a central place that I can keep my articles, blogs and “notes-to-self”. ![Comedy Business 70](/Portals/50/images/%5BProvider%5D/%5BFolderFilePath%5D/WLW/CentralizingMyNotes_1249F/Comedy%20Business%2070_3.gif "Comedy Business 70")Well, I’ve finally gotten around to setting up my own site for all of this, at http://kb.Gilleland.info. I’ve had my own domain for a while now, and have finally decided to set up a sub-domain, which I’ve called “kb”, for “Knowledge Base”. Over the next few weeks (and working around my holidays & camping) I’m going to see about moving/mirroring many of my postings from other places onto this site. In the mean time, I’ll be playing around with categorizing and customizing how WLW works with my site.
