# Visio Guy » Blog Archive » Do You Know Your Elements? A Visio Periodic Table
OK, these Visio templates are just too cool! Not only are the Periodic Table shapes cool, but there are a lot of others too:  Bingo shapes  Smart-Fading Tree  USB Stick shape   Multi-Earth shape  and many more that I won't list here but that you can find at http://www.visguy.com/shapes/  I ran across these when I was doing a quick search for Visio templates that I could use for quickly mocking up web page and web control elements. I also ran across this template from the Interaction Designer's Coffee Break blog.  Lastly, I have to make note of how the Visio Guy actually takes time to explain how his templates work and are designed. For example, take a look at his description of how to make a glass cover effect - wow! And, he has references to other good resources for those interested in creating their own Visio graphics.  Of course, seeing is believing, and it behoves me (I love to use rarely-used words) to show you some screen-shots.      Thank you "Visio Guy" (aka Chris Roth)! (And by the way, you can donate if you use & appreciate his work...)   Technorati Tags: Visio  Visio Guy » Blog Archive » Do You Know Your Elements? A Visio Periodic Table

## Visio Guy » Blog Archive » Do You Know Your Elements? A Visio Periodic Table


OK, these Visio templates are just too cool! Not only are the Periodic Table shapes cool, but there are a lot of others too:


- [Bingo](http://www.visguy.com/2008/01/23/visio-bingo-template/) shapes
- [Smart-Fading Tree](http://www.visguy.com/2007/12/03/smartshape-tutorial-fading-trees/)
- [USB Stick](http://www.visguy.com/2007/12/03/smartshape-tutorial-fading-trees/) shape
- [Multi-Earth](http://www.visguy.com/2007/06/06/multi-earth-shape/) shape
- and many more that I won't list here but that you can find at [http://www.visguy.com/shapes/](http://www.visguy.com/shapes/ "http://www.visguy.com/shapes/")



I ran across these when I was doing a quick search for Visio templates that I could use for quickly mocking up web page and web control elements. I also ran across [this template](http://www.guuui.com/issues/02_07.php) from the Interaction Designer's Coffee Break blog.



Lastly, I have to make note of how the Visio Guy actually takes time to explain how his templates work and are designed. For example, take a look at his description of how to make a [glass cover effect](http://www.visguy.com/2008/03/18/how-to-draw-glass-in-visio/) - wow! And, he has [references to other good resources](http://www.visguy.com/2007/05/04/data-graphics-resources/) for those interested in creating their own Visio graphics.



Of course, seeing is believing, and it behoves me (I love to use rarely-used words) to show you some screen-shots.
