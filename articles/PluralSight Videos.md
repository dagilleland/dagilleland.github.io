I stumbled onto a site called [PluralSight](http://www.pluralsight.com/main/) that has a few nice looking videos. They do training in .NET development. Here’s a couple of the videos that caught my attention:


- [ASP.NET Validation Controls](http://www.pluralsight.com/main/screencasts/screencast.aspx?id=validation-controls-isvalid) – I found this interesting, not so much for myself as for my students.
- [Introducing the .NET Workflow Service](http://www.pluralsight.com/main/screencasts/screencast.aspx?id=wf-service-hellocloudwf) – \*\*\*\*\* I’ve always wanted to get into using Workflow – this video should be a good quick-start. **It looks like they have a *lot* of videos on Workflow Services.** Gotta check them out….
- [Web Sites, Applications, and Virtual Directories in IIS](http://www.pluralsight.com/main/screencasts/screencast.aspx?id=iis-aspnetdev) – Again, this is more for my students, but I’ll take a look at it too ‘cause you never know when you’ll learn something new.
- [Understanding ViewState in ASO.NET](http://www.pluralsight.com/main/screencasts/screencast.aspx?id=understanding-viewstate) – Again, for my students.



Well, that’s my first quick look at their sight. You might find it interesting too. Bye for now!
