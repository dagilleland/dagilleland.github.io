# metaPost & Me
I've been working on a provider for metaPost, which is a DotNetNuke module that allows publishing content to a DNN portal via tools like Windows Live Writer. With metaPost, you can publish to the Blog module, Ventrian's News Articles, regular text/html modules, and the FAQ module. The provider I'm working on is for the Announcements module, and I hope to have that done in a few weeks.  You can read more about my progress in the blog for the Announcements module.
