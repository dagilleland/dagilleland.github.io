The ultimate essence of evil is to prefer anything to God

https://youtu.be/-zzsi3uYNZ8?t=33m3os What Jesus achieved when He died for our sins.
The ultimate thing for which Jesus died is not
 - forgiveness of sins
 - removal of wrath
 - defeat of the devil
 - deliverance from hell
 - resurrection of our bodies
 - healing of every disease
 - entrance into Heaven
 
 1 Peter 3:18 - Christ suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that He might bring us to God.

"There is enormous pressure today to think of Good (the opposite of evil) in ways that have nothing to do with God." - John Piper

"The ultimate essence of evil is the loss of taste for God as our all-satisfying life and joy. Or, flip the coin over, The ultimate essence of evil is a preference for other things, other people, anything created, more than God. That is the ultimate essence of evil, biblically." - John Piper
