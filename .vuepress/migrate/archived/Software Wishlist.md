## Software Wishlist


Well, with Christmas approaching, it's hard not to think of what software I would love to have to complete my suite of tools. Here's my top 10ish:


- [r.a.d. AJAX](http://www.telerik.com/products/ajax/r.a.d.ajax.aspx?gad=CMKQ0uoDEgit40-D1s3CphiF1bL_AyCmz_sU), by Telerek
- CodeSmith tools
- Refactor! professional
- Flash 8 (basic or professional)
- Microsoft Office 2007 (coming out in early 2007)
