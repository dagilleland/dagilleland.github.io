## Jing – Free Screen Capture from TechSmith


I was looking over the latest version of some TechSmith software (specifically Camtasia) to see what features are in the new version (I have Camtasia 4.x and the current one is version 6.x). As I was browsing around, I ran across this free product that they offer: [Jing](http://www.techsmith.com/jing/default.asp).

Jing is a simple screen capture program that can capture a single image (allowing you to do add text, boxes & arrows to it) or a short video (5 minute limit). For the image capture it saves it as a PNG file, and for videos it saves it as a SWF. For example, the above image was captured from Jing, as was the short video below.

Note that the flash file has to be uploaded to a SharePoint site as a file. To actually show the swf in this blog, I tried to embed the final URL of the file in a manually added <object> tag, but it looks like the SharePoint strips out that html when posting (bummer). Other sites that allow attachments such as SWFs should work find.
