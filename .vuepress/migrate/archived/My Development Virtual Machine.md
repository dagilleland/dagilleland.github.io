## My Development Virtual Machine


![Virtual Machines](images/2009/WLW-MyDevelopmentVirtualMachine_5058-Home%20Improvement%2060_3.png "Virtual Machines") A few years ago, I was blessed to win an MSDN subscription, and with it a number of development tools & OSes. Just recently, I started into building a collection of virtual computers for my own software development as well as for use on NAIT projects, so I thought I would take a moment to outline my dev computer's contents here.

My overall approach is to use differencing disks, which allows me to have a base from which to create brand-new computers with all my regular software in under 5 minutes! I'm still building my system, but within this week, I'll have the base VHDs from which to make a number of virtual machines for the different projects I'm working on. The following diagram illustrates my current plan for what computers I'm hoping to set up.
