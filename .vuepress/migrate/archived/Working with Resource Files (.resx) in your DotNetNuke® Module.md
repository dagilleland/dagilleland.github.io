## Working with Resource Files (.resx) in your DotNetNuke® Module


Almost every DNN module extension will need to include labels, link buttons or other controls that include literal text created by the module developer. This article shows how you can move that hard-coded text into Resource Files. Using Resource Files, you can make your module extension fit snuggly into DotNetNuke's localization capabilities.

 

This article is part of a suite of articles on module development basics.
