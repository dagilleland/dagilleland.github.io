# Improving Vista Performance
I just checked out an article on tips to improve Vista performance. Now, most of these tips I already knew about, but one tip caught my eye and prompted this blog: ReadyBoost.  It appears that ReadyBoost is a way to use the Flash drive memory from a memory stick to support the OS's memory swapping. Quoting the article, "Microsoft estimates that you can benefit from a ReadyBoost cache equal to approximately 150 percent of your system RAM—for example, a 1.5 GB ReadyBoost cache on a 1 GB system." So, is you've got 2GB RAM already, you can use about 3GB of the flash drive for ReadyBoost caching. Cool!
