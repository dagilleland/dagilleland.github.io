## DNN Educational Modules


Well, as I get further into this term's teaching, I'm realizing more and more that I want to be using DotNetNuke for my instructor portal, but I really need to develop/get some educational-use modules. I need modules to do stuff like managing marks and assignments for users/students. A quick look at the different categories of community modules shows that there is no category for Educational modules, so aside from Googling, I'm left with creating my own (which probably is a good thing, if only I had the time).



So, for now, the best place to start is with making some requirements for these modules. Sigh... I need a staff....
