## StatBrain – See How Your Website is Doing…


I stumbled upon a site called [StatBrain](http://www.statbrain.com) that gives very general statistics on page visits to a domain. For example, if I go to [StatBrain](http://www.statbrain.com) and type in my site ([kb.Gilleland.info](http://www.statbrain.com/www.kb.gilleland.info/)), I get the following results:



![StatBrain for http://kb.Gilleland.info](images/2009/WLW-StatBrainSeeHowYourWebsiteisDoing_115B-image_3.png "StatBrain for http://kb.Gilleland.info")



So, try [StatBrain](http://www.StatBrain.com) on your website, and see what you think. Is it accurate?
