## When You Want to Leave FaceBook…


What do you do, when you want to leave [FaceBook](http://www.FaceBook.com)? Well, you have three choices:


1. **Abandon** your [FaceBook](http://www.FaceBook.com) account – This choice is the easiest, and is often used by people who just grow disinterested in [FaceBook](http://www.FaceBook.com).        
Leave it alone, don't update it or check it. If it gets your interest again, you can come back to it.        
This is akin to those abandoned vehicles you see in the countryside now and again. They are just cast aside, but sitting on and still part of the owner's property.
2. **Disable** your [FaceBook](http://www.FaceBook.com) account – This is like abandoning it, but with you going to extra work adjusting your settings on [FaceBook](http://www.FaceBook.com). Your account isn't deleted, but it's "gone". You can reclaim it at a later time.
3. **Delete** your [FaceBook](http://www.FaceBook.com) account – This goes is like disabling, but goes the extra step to permanently get rid of your data. It's a harder option to find (see [this article](http://www.itbusiness.ca/it/client/en/home/News.asp?id=53975) by Brian Jackson).
