## Reading Blog


Too much to do, to little time to do it. That's seemed to be the theme for the last few years, particularly as I've gotten more and more into using DotNetNuke and developing my programming skills.



One of the things that I've been thinking of doing since re-vamping my personal website is to get a bit more into blogging, and write about a wide variety of topics (not just IT-related stuff). One of those things I've thought of writing about was to write up some thoughts on books as I read them, so here's my first Reading Blog (but not the first book since I re-vamped the site).

The Silver Sword, by Angela Elwell Hunt.



I really enjoyed this book.
