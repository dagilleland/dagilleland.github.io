## How do you know that Christianity the the one true religion?


A question is asked, "How do you know that Christianity is the one true religion?" Here is a good quote:

   
 

> "**Origin**, **meaning**, **morality**and **destiny**. The Judeo-Christian worldview is not the only one that claims exclusivity, but its the only one that takes those four questions with corresponding answers that are truthful and coherent answers that stand the test of time, and the ultimate answer of the resurrection from the dead that gives you hope and meaning." ([*source link*](http://kb.gilleland.info/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.youtube.com%2fwatch%3fv%3dnWY-6xBA0Pk%26feature%3dplayer_detailpage%23t%3d397s&amp;tabid=808&amp;mid=1674))  
>  - Ravi Zacharias

  
 Ravi Zacharias does a good job addressing this, as seen in[ this YouTube video](http://youtu.be/nWY-6xBA0Pk). 

All worldviews can be grouped under only three categories

 

- Only the universe exists  
     naturalism, athiesm  
 - Only God exists  
     Buddhism  
 - Both God and the universe exists  
     Judaism, Christianity, Islam
