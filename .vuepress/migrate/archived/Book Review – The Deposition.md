# Book Review – The Deposition

## Overview

This story centers around Father Scott Nolan and his <!--Begin mp_html_link_1_5e6972ac-->deposition<sup class="itcexpand-super">1</sup><!--End mp_html_link_1_5e6972ac--><!--End mp_html_link_1_d50ebb5e--> in relation to a lawsuit over a bank trust. The deposition, however, is a front for extracting information from Father Scott that might lead the bad guys to a witness who is under federal protection and slated to testify before a grand jury.

The "bad guys" are mostly lawyers, but so are a lot of the good guys (even Father Scott has a background as a lawyer).

## Review ![3.5 out of 5 stars](images/2009/WLW-BookReviewTheDeposition_129D5-stars-3-5_3.gif "3.5 out of 5 stars")

Overall, I enjoyed [The Deposition](http://www.amazon.ca/exec/obidos/ASIN/1589191013/dynamicgenera-20), but it took a bit for me at the start to follow the players and the dialogue. It's a novel where there is little action, but a lot of dialogue and the air of missing pieces being filled in as you move along. It might have helped me if I had read the previous four books in this fifth of the Mike Connolly Mystery Series; then I may have known more about some of the characters, particularly Mike Connolly. Mike's part in the novel is mostly as a background character, but one of great significance.

I like the way dialogue is used as the primary way to tell the story (as opposed to having a narrator's voice). It keeps you wondering what the real story is about (hint: it's *not* about the lawsuit over the bank trust). Information is revealed a bit at a time, and the background action of the minor players in the story hints at the significance of the dialogue in the <!--Begin mp_html_link_1_d50ebb5e--><!--Begin mp_html_link_1_5e6972ac-->deposition<sup class="itcexpand-super">1</sup><!--End mp_html_link_1_5e6972ac-->. The ending is pretty good too, but I won't spoil it for you.

I would give the book a three-and-a-half out of five star rating. ![3.5 out of 5 stars](./images/2009/WLW-BookReviewTheDeposition_129D5-stars-3-5_6.gif "3.5 out of 5 stars")
