# Blog on Project Management

This was a [great read](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001161.html) from Jeff Atwood of *Coding Horror*. I'm going to have to take some time this coming week to actually follow up on some of the links he has in his article, as it looks like a really good resource for trying to "get the job done".
