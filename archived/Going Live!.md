# Going Live!
This is my first post to Windows Live Space. You may have found me here, but my main location is at Gilleland.info.  I also have a number of web sites that I run (all of which are built on DotNetNuke):  Dynamic Generation Inc. - This is my part-time business, where I mostly develop web sites based on DotNetNuke (although, I do other IT development work as well).  TryDNN.com - On this site, I plan to add articles for the general masses about how to get up and running with DotNetNuke.  Gilleland.info - This (as mentioned) is my personal site. It's quite a bit rough around the edges, and (eventually) I'll build a better skin, but hey - I only have so much time in my life!  Computer Systems Technology (CST) - This is where I teach computer programming full time (at NAIT). I have my own staff site as well, and since most of my writing is related to my teaching, this is where a lot of my on-line posting energy is going of late. BTW, CST is also the program that I graduated from (CST Diploma, Honours, 1998).  The list above isn't complete, but it's a highlight of the major ones I'm running. Also, BTW, I'm writing this post using Windows Live Writer, which I've gotten into because of how well I can write offline and still post to my DotNetNuke (DNN) websites. I much prefer to write off-line and then publish, and now that I'm using metaPost for DotNetNuke, my "publishing chain" is complete. I'll probably write a bit more about metaPost in another blog.

## Going Live!


(Taken from my [Windows Live blog](http://dagilleland.spaces.live.com/blog/))



This is my first post to Windows Live Space. You may have found me here, but my main location is at [Gilleland.info](http://www.Gilleland.info "Gilleland.info - Home of Dan Gilleland").



I also have a number of web sites that I run (all of which are built on [DotNetNuke](http://www.DotNetNuke.com)):


- [Dynamic Generation Inc.](http://www.DynamicGeneration.com) - This is my part-time business, where I mostly develop web sites based on DotNetNuke (although, I do other IT development work as well).
- [TryDNN.com](http://www.TryDNN.com) - On this site, I plan to add [articles](http://www.trydnn.com/Articles/tabid/776/Default.aspx) for the general masses about how to get up and running with DotNetNuke.
- [Gilleland.info](http://www.Gilleland.info) - This (as mentioned) is my personal site. It's quite a bit rough around the edges, and (eventually) I'll build a better skin, but hey - I only have so much time in my life!         
[***June, 2009 Update**: I've since set up my own DotNetNuke site for posting my blogs at kb.Gilleland.info and articles (and have posted mirrors of what I've got at*[*Windows Live*](http://dagilleland.spaces.live.com/blog/) and other blog sites*).*
- [Computer Systems Technology (CST)](http://cst.nait.ca) - This is where I teach computer programming full time (at [NAIT](http://www.NAIT.ca)). I have my own [staff site](http://cst.nait.ca/staff/dgilleland) as well, and since most of my writing is related to my teaching, this is where a lot of my on-line posting energy is going of late. BTW, [CST](http://cst.nait.ca) is also the program that I graduated from (CST Diploma, Honours, 1998).
