## Developing a Settings User Control for your DotNetNuke® Module


Part of creating module extensions for the DotNetNuke® framework involves developing a user interface (UI). Often a project uses constants or other metadata which surrounds the module's content or affects the module's behaviour. A common way to expose these settings for customization by someone with module Edit permissions is through developing a Settings.ascx user control. This article explains how a Settings user control integrates with the DotNetNuke framework and how you can leverage ModuleSettings and TabModuleSettings in your project.
