## Ventrian's News Articles


[**[![Ventrian&#39;s News Articles Module](images/2009/WLW-VentriansNewsArticles_FB9E-image_thumb_1.png "Ventrian&#39;s News Articles Module")](images/2009/WLW-VentriansNewsArticles_FB9E-image_4.png)**](http://www.ventrian.com/Products/Modules/NewsArticles.aspx) [**Ventrian's News Articles**](http://www.ventrian.com/Products/Modules/NewsArticles.aspx) by <!--Begin mp_html_link_1_5dadbdca-->Scott McCulloch<sup class="itcexpand-super">1</sup><!--End mp_html_link_1_5dadbdca--> is one of the most popular and fully-featured modules for creating articles on [DotNetNuke](http://www.DotNetNuke.com)<sup>®</sup>.



Originally released in March 2005, this module has gone through a lot of versions (the current being 00.07.45, commonly called 7.45). It works in DotNetNuke 4.5.5 and higher. It has a number of features, including


- **Workflow capabilities**, allowing for large teams of writers and editors
- **Advanced article management**, such as tagging articles for categories or being featured or secure and allowing full control of drafts and start/end publishing dates
- **Fully customizable layout**, through the use of layout templates
- **Companion modules** for showing latest articles or archives
- **Reader Comments and RSS feeds** (by latest, categories, and author)



There are other features, of course, and the purpose of this review isn't to name them, but to simply point you in the direction of [Ventrian](http://www.Ventrian.com)'s website ([www.Ventrian.com](http://www.Ventrian.com)) so that you can learn more.



I've been using this News Articles module for years now, and I have to say it is the <!--Begin mp_html_link_2_5dadbdca-->"best of breed"<sup class="itcexpand-super">2</sup><!--End mp_html_link_2_5dadbdca--> that is out there. The long-standing development and support by the author is another reason that this is simply a must-have module for almost any DotNetNuke site. It gets even better when you add in [IT Crossing](http://www.itcrossing.com/)'s [**metaPost**](http://dnn.itcrossing.com/products/modules/metapost/) module that allows authors to post from [**Windows Live Writer**](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com) or other [wysiwyg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG) editors that support uploading through [MetaWeblog API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaWeblog).
