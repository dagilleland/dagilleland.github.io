## Finally! metaPost :)


> *Note: This is an earlier article of mine from 2008 which is now ported over to my Knowledge Base website.*



Well, I've not blogged on any consistent level. But now, thanks in no small part to [metaPost](http://www.itcrossing.com), I think I might get back into the blogging/publishing scene some more.



My blogging vacillates between using the News Articles module or the DNN Blog module. I really like the News Articles module because of a) the different categories and b) the multi-page feature and c) the control of the publishing workflow (submission/approval/etc). There's other reasons, too, such as the cleaner Admin tools (more icon-based). But in truth, I haven't kept up with DNN's Blog module, and I'm sure the latest version is a *lot* better than the one I was looking at back at the DNN 3.x and 4.0.x days (2006/7).



But there's more to my being out of the blogging besides "which module do I use". I've also been out of it because of the "bother". Sometimes, it's just too much work using a blog. Think of it. You typically have to:


1. Go to the web site
2. Log in
3. Go to your blog page
4. Click [whatever] to start a new blog
5. Write your content, proof it, get it all right
6. Post/publish it



Whew!



Well, with [metaPost](http://www.itcrossing.com), it's a whole lot easier to do this in a DNN-based web site! All I have to do for a new post is


1. Open up Windows Live Writer (WLW) or MS Word
2. Write my content
3. Publish to my blog



That's only half of the steps to the web-based approach - and two of those steps are just mouse-clicks! And there's more benefits to the WLW approach:



| **Using the Browser** | **Using Windows Live Writer** |
| No "undo" to fix/revert content after posting. You have to go back into the post & re-write the changes by hand. | As long as you still have WLW open, you can just "undo" and re-post. |
| Images are a pain! If you want to use one, you have to upload the image, then get the image link embedded right. At a minimum, it's a two-step process, with the first step taking a *lot* of clicks. | Images are easy. If you insert a picture, then WLW will upload the picture to your blog for you. It's a simple one-step world. |
| Can't work on a blog off-line. At all. | Write your blog off-line, and even save a draft off-line. Publish it when you're ready. |







If I took the time to think about it, there's probably a bunch of other niggley things with the browser-based approach to editing/writing the blogs or articles. But when you discover all the extra plug-ins available for Windows Live Writer, then you just *have to* go that way. WLW has been around for a little while (in beta during 2007), and other off-line blog posting programs have been around since the start of 2007 (some, maybe earlier).



But the problem with the different blog-posting programs is that they've mostly relied on 3rd party blogging sites. I wanted to write stuff for my own DNN-based web site. I like having total control of my own web site. It doesn't just have to be a "blog" - I can extend it any way I need or want. Hey - I'm a developer, so I'm often thinking of new or better ways of doing things. But there weren't any DNN modules to bridge the gap between off-line tools and DNN. That is, until [metaPost](http://www.itcrossing.com).



I'll probably write a bit more about [metaPost](http://www.itcrossing.com) as I get time to explore its features and use it more. But one thing's for sure: I'm going to be able to blog & write articles easier and faster, thanks to WLW + [metaPost](http://www.itcrossing.com) + DNN. (No more excuses - I hope!)
