## Code Snippets on HOT4DNN


Writers are advised to use the SyntaxHighlighter support when inserting Code Snippets for articles on HOT4DNN.

 

For example, the following code was inserted using the PreCode plug-in for Windows Live Writer (Scott Hanselman has a [nice blog post about using these](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BestCodeSyntaxHighlighterForSnippetsInYourBlog.aspx)).



    // Hello3.csusing System;public class Hello3{   public static void Main(string[] args)   {      Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");      Console.WriteLine("You entered the following {0} command line arguments:",         args.Length );      for (int i=0; i &lt; args.Length; i++)      {         Console.WriteLine("{0}", args[i]);       }   }}

 

Right now, this is being tested out on my site.
