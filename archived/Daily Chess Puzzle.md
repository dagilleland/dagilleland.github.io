# Daily Chess Puzzle
A friend recently introduced me to GameKnot - a place that you can play chess online with others. Among the other interesting features are the Daily Puzzles, which you can also embed in your own site, as I have done on my instructor site. It doesn't insert well into this blog, however, as the script filtering on this rich-text editor strips out the javascript reference that is required to get the game on the site.  I was, however, able to get the game on my instructor site at NAIT.

## Daily Chess Puzzle

A friend recently introduced me to [GameKnot](http://www.gameknot.com/) - a place that you can play chess online with others. Among the other interesting features are the Daily Puzzles, which you can also embed in your own site, as I have done on my instructor site. It doesn't insert well into this blog, however, as the script filtering on this rich-text editor strips out the javascript reference that is required to get the game on the site.



I was, however, able to get the game on [my instructor site](http://cst.nait.ca/staff/dgilleland/OtherStuff/PlayaLittle/tabid/122/Default.aspx) at NAIT.
