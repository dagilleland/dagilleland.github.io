## Feeling at Home


> **When I think of the wisdom and scope of God's plan, I fall to my knees and pray to the Father, the Creator of everything in heaven and on earth. I pray that from his glorious, unlimited resources he will give you mighty inner strength through his Holy Spirit. And I pray that Christ will be more and more at home in your hearts as you trust in him. May your roots go down deep into the soil of God's marvelous love.**

I was reading this passage today, and the phrase that stuck out for me was "I pray that Christ will be more and more at home in your hearts".



As a believer in and follower of Jesus, I know that He lives in my heart. Yet, I also know that many times, I haven't made my heart a comfortable place for Him to live in. The imagery of being "more and more at home" struck me, because I can relate to how in some people's homes I feel quite comfortable while at other places I feel quite uncomfortable.



*Jesus, please help me in my heart, so that it can be a place that you feel at home. I give you freedom to re-arrange the furniture and to say what stays and what goes. Help me, Holy Spirit, in doing a good and thorough "house cleaning". Teach me and grow in me the habits that help keep my heart tidy: taking out the garbage, cleaning up the messes, and putting things in their proper place. Let my heart and my life be a place that you want to call home.*

### Prayer for Spiritual Strength


14 For this reason I bow my knees before the Father, 15 from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, 16 that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being, 17 so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faithâ€”that you, being rooted and grounded in love, 18 may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth, 19 and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
