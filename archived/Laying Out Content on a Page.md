# Laying Out Content on a Page


Changing layout on a page is largely a matter of moving content modules around on the page. In this tutorial, we will take a page of content and change the layout by re-arranging modules on a page. This tutorial uses the terms "module", "skin" and "pane" quite frequently, so you may want to review some basic DotNetNuke [terms and concepts **[link]**] before proceeding.

## Laying Out Content on a Page


This tutorial uses the DotNetNuke Demo portals available through http://demo.dotnetnuke.com as the starting point. You can review the article "Try DNN" [http://www.trydnn.com/Articles/tabid/776/ctl/ArticleView/mid/1585/articleId/23/Try-DNN.aspx] to set up your own demo portal before beginning this tutorial.

Changing layout on a page is largely a matter of moving content modules around on the page. (This presumes, of course, that you are following best design practices [FOOTNOTE] and that you have more than one module on a page. [[FOOTNOTE] Best practices for designing pages includes organizing your page's content in modules. See the article about [planning your page's content & layout [link]]].) You can move modules to different panes on the page or re-order the modules within a given pane.

 

The pictures below show the original layout and the modified layout after completing the tutorial.

1. To start, we will move certain modules to different panes. This can be done through the Module Actions menu or by dragging the module from one pane to another. (For beginners, we recommend using the Module Actions menu to re-arrange the modules.)     
 - Move the *Links* module to the right pane.

 - Move the *Sponsors* module to the left pane

 - Move the *Welcome...* module to the top pane

 - Move the *DotNetNuke License* module to the bottom pane

2. Next, we will change the order of a couple of modules in the right pane.     
 - Move the *Links* module up above the *Open Source* module

3. Lastly, we will remove the Books module from the left pane. (There are two ways to remove that module: a) Delete the module, or b) Move the module to another page. We will show both ways here; simply choose which way you want.)     
 - To delete the Books module entirely, select Delete from the module actions menu   
![Select Delete from the Books' module action menu](/Portals/_TryDNN/Articles/Layout_Content/Delete.png)
 - To preseve the Books module by moving it to another page, you will need to go into the module's settings:         
  1. Select Settings from the module action menu

  2. Open the Page Settings and Advanced Settings areas and select which page you wish to move the module to.
