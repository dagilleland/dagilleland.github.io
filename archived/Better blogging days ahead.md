## Better blogging days ahead


I'm nearing the end of a big project, and I've had the chance to learn a lot of little tips & nuggets of stuff with regard to DNN, particularly the new version 4.3.5 (the 4.3.4+ release is only a couple months old, now).



Once this big project is done, I hope to have some "time off" to rest, do my personal DNN development, and blog a bit more.
