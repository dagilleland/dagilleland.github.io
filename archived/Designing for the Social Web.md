## Designing for the Social Web

I ran accross a [blog post](http://www.nikhilk.net/Entry.aspx?id=218) about a book on designing social experiences on the web. It looks interesting, and might be a good read for consideration on any websites we create for raising student (or prospective student) use of our CST website(s).



I particularly liked the image & comment on the **Usage Lifecycle**. That is the "stage[s] a user goes through and the hurdles a designer must design for" in order to create a better social website.
