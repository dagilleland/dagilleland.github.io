## Better Search Engine Indexing
It looks like Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo! have all agreed on something: How to make it easier for websites to tell them what to crawl. In [this article](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9005148&amp;intsrc=news_ts_head), I discovered SiteMaps ([www.sitemaps.org](http://www.sitemaps.org)) - a place where you can learn about and get the XML format needed to write your own "sitemap.xml" file that the search engines will use to map out the parts of your site to crawl for their indexing. All in all, it's pretty cool!
