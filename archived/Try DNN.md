# Try DNN


One of the best ways to see what **DotNetNuke®** can do and how easy it is to get working with it is to actually take it for a "test drive".



The wonderful folks at **[DotNetNuke](http://www.DotNetNuke.com)** have set up a place where you can sign up & get your own Demo Portal ***absolutely free***. These free sites last between 24 and 48 hours, but they can be a great place to "get your feet wet".



This article tells you how to set up your own demo portal with DotNetNuke. This is a great way to build your own "sandbox" so you can play with all the features that are available.

Lastly, if your demo portal winds up expiring and getting deleted before you get a chance to really play with it, you can go through these steps again, using the same information you used the first time.



Here is how you can set up your own demo portal with DotNetNuke.


1. Browse to [http://demo.dotnetnuke.com/](http://demo.dotnetnuke.com/) (this link will open a new browser window, and you can [ALT] + [TAB] to switch between this article and DotNetNuke's demo site)
2. Click "Create Your Demo Account" link

3. Fill in the form and click the "Create Website" link. The following image shows you what you can expect for the form. Of course, you would fill in your own information for the different fields (Website Name, Title, etc.). Once you've filled in the form and have clicked the "Create Website" link, wait until your new website's page loads up (this may take a minute or so to get created).       
Note the fact that **your demo website will only be active for 24hrs**, after which the site will be removed. This short-term site is just so you can play around and try out the capabilities of DotNetNuke.

"*\***Note**: Once your website is created, you will need to login using the Administrator information specified above. Depending on volume, it can sometimes take a few minutes to fully provision your demo website. Please be patient.*"
4. Once your new website loads up, click the "Login" link to log on       
![Your Demo Website is Created](/Portals/_TryDNN/Articles/Try_DNN/D.png)
5. Enter your username & password in the login page       
![Login to your Demo Website](/Portals/_TryDNN/Articles/Try_DNN/E.png)
6. You should see your username below the Search box.       
![Successfully Logged In](/Portals/_TryDNN/Articles/Try_DNN/F.png)



That's all there is to it! Now, take some time to play around and check out the features of your demo portal. You can try out some of the tutorials on this site, or check out the Guided Tour for a good introduction to working with DotNetNuke. If you find that your demo website expires, simply go through these steps again and re-create it from the beginning. Remember, the whole idea of the Demo portals is to have a safe place to learn about using DotNetNuke, away from your own live website.
