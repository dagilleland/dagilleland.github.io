## Personal Project Management: The Quest


TBA



The beauty of paper and a simple to-do list      
- simplicity       
- immediacy



The bane of paper to-do lists      
- too many       
- gets lost/misplaced       
- old lists stay around (w. items un-checked)       
- what did I do today?



The limitations      
- not tied to source (disconnected)       
- can't aggregate or search       
- status: done or not done, no "other" or "postponed" status to apply







Types of ToDo/Task Lists      
  o People (appointments/contacts)       
  o Projects (tasks, priority, development & "tools integration", "what I got done", billing, planning, etc)

# The Quest


I teach computer programming full time and run my own IT business part time. It's a wonderful combination, because my work in each area helps to support the other. But, it has its pitfalls.



The biggest shortcoming of these two jobs is that I have so many "irons in the fire" that it's hard to keep all my projects straight. On top of that, I often get great ideas for projects that I may never get around to actually implementing (mainly, because my own business is a one-man show).



In light of this shortcoming, I have sporadically ventured on the quest for a meaningful and easy-to-use toolset to improve my productivity. I want it all: Project Management, Code Repository, Document Management, Collaboration Capacity, and Customer Feedback. Oh, and one last thing: I want it to be free (or almost free)! After all, as a one-man IT shop that can't afford employees (yet…), I need to trim my costs as much as possible.



The path of this quest has often been vague, and I have found myself running after this, that and the other thing. Recently, however, my quest has started to take some shape, and I've begun comparing different solutions (and combinations). Here's a chart of my initial findings:
