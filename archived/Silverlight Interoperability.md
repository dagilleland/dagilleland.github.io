# Silverlight Interoperability
If you've heard of Silverlight but are not sure of how to integrate it with what you've already got ("I'm already using Ajax" or "I'm not really wanting to replace what I've got with Silverlight"), then this might be a good article to read. It's got some code snippets, but it doesn't focus on a single aspect or usage of Silverlight. Rather, it tries to show how Silverlight can be used "to enhance your existing website in a non-obtrusive way".  Wilco Bauwer - "Silverlight Interoperability"

It's got some code snippets, but it doesn't focus on a single aspect or usage of Silverlight. Rather, it tries to show how Silverlight can be used "to enhance your existing website in a *non-obtrusive* way".
