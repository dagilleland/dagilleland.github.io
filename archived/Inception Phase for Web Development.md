## Inception Phase for Web Development
So, I'm approached by an organization that wants to hire me to help build them a "portal" (which is just a fancy way of saying they want a website). The trouble is, from all they've told me so far, they have a pretty fuzzy picture of what they want, but they are eager to get an estimate of how much time it will take and how much it will cost. After all, they are hiring me because I'm the expert, and they've never ever owned (let alone "built") a website before.  
 Whoa there, Nelly, hold your horses!  
 If I were to follow the thoughts of Dan North and begin with the idea that we've got to face the fact that our ignorance is going to be the greatest barrier, then I am definitely going to need some sit-down time before I come anywhere near giving them an estimate on time and cost. Furthermore, I have to be careful not to fall into [the trap of giving them precision instead of accuracy](http://kb.gilleland.info/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fdannorth.net%2f2009%2f07%2f01%2fthe-perils-of-estimation%2f&amp;tabid=808&amp;mid=1674). And remember, they don't know *anything* about websites or portals (other than that they need one).  
 We need to sit down and spend some time on *deliberate discovery*. So, I need a block of time (not just a half-hour meeting) to go over some basic questions. You see, I need to get an idea from them of what they think "done" will look like. *[Note to self: [Don't confuse Velocity with "Done"](http://kb.gilleland.info/LinkClick.aspx?link=http%3a%2f%2fwww.dtsato.com%2fblog%2f2009%2f07%2f03%2fvelocity-gone-wrong-done-is-not-done%2f&amp;tabid=808&amp;mid=1674)]*  
 To start off, pretend that this "portal" that they want is actually a brick-and-mortar building. Here's my questions (in no particular order):  
 - What kind of building is it (a house, a shed, a skyscraper)?  
 - Where do you want to put it? *[domain name, hosting]*
