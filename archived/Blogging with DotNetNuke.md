# Blogging with DotNetNuke

DotNetNuke is a framework on which you can build your website. Of course, when you have a website, you want to put content on it. A commonly sought type of content is a Weblog (or ***blog*** for short). DotNetNuke comes with a Blog module that you can use, or you can use other third-party modules, like Ventrian's News Articles module.

Beyond the blog itself, you will want a way for you (& others on your site) to post blogs. Of course, people can just go to the site, log on, and make their blog entry. But a lot of people like to create their blogs "offline" and "publish" (that is, upload) their blog later on. They would use programs like Word or LiveWriter to do this (like I am doing right now).

If you are interested in having a website with blog, then read on and I'll tell you more about how to get started with blogging on DotNetNuke.
