## Women in Ministy


Don Rousu has written an [article](http://www.christianity.ca/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=3645) in 2004 on women in ministry (["The Truth About Women in Public Ministry"](http://www.christianity.ca/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=3645)). In it, he examines what the Bible has to say about this topic and challenges some of the "traditional" views that restrict women from public ministry.



I wrote a similar paper for Bible School back in the early â€˜90s. It's in paper form right now, but I hope to scan it someday to publish on the web.
