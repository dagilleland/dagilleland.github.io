## Momentum...


Well, this blog is less about really having something to say and more about getting into a habit of blogging...






* * *






Today, I've been back at teaching at NAIT, and getting into the swing of things. This term, I'm teaching a first-level course (Java) and a fourth-level course (Flash). It's nice teaching stuff I've done before, 'cause the prep for the classes gets easier. The hard part is often seeing all the extra I would like to do to get the courses beefed up. It takes a while, and, being a bit of a perfectionist, never seems to end....



What I'm really looking forward to is finally getting my new computer at work! I've been without one for just over a week now, having handed over my aging laptop and the loaner lab computer so that they can be "cascaded" for other purposes. But because the replacement computers have been slow in coming, I'm learning to do without for a short while, relying on lab computers.



On a more positive note, I've got my database access back, after having it "broken" with a domain migration that happened over holidays. Now I can get around to reviving a DNN installation & getting my notes back :)
