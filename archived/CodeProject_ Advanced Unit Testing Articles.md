## CodeProject: Advanced Unit Testing Articles


[![125x125](http://www.codeproject.com/Info/images/codeproject125x125.gif)](http://www.CodeProject.com)[CodeProject](http://www.CodeProject.com) is one of the favorite places I like to go to whenever I want to learn from others. So, when my Google search on unit testing lead me to an article on [CodeProject](http://www.CodeProject.com)'s site, I knew I was going in the right direction.



Here, I want to feature a set of five articles by <!--Begin mp_html_link_1_935392bb-->Marc Clifton<sup class="itcexpand-super">1</sup><!--End mp_html_link_1_935392bb--> from 2003/04. It was the fifth article that first caught my attention, but in reviewing the earlier articles in the series, I know I want to remember to check them out again. So, here they are:


- [Advanced Unit Testing, Part I - Overview](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/autp1.aspx)
- [Advanced Unit Testing, Part II – Core Implementation](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/autp2.aspx)
