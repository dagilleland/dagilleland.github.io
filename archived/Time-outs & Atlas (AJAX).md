## Time-outs & Atlas (AJAX)
Well, I just read an [interesting article](http://msmvps.com/blogs/omar/archive/2006/09/23/Atlas-5_3A00_-Bad-calls-make-good-calls-timeout.aspx). It talks about how when using AJAX you can sometimes have good calls to the server time out because of one bad call. The resolution proposed is to write your own code to do a "retry" of a failed call (to try and get the good call to go through). I wonder, though, what that might mean if a retry is done on what amounts to a bad call. Hmm....
