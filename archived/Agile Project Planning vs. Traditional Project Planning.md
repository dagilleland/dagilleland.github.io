## Agile Project Planning vs. Traditional Project Planning


I read an [article at ExtremePlanner.com](http://www.extremeplanner.com/articles/Agile-Project-Planning.html) that takes a look at traditional project planning and the tensions/problems inherent to that approach.



It's interesting to note how important project planning is to the success or failure of a project, and to see that some of the tensions built into the traditional approach ("plan everything, then develop") will naturally undermine the success of a project. In many ways, I see this as yet another reason that Agile project planning stands heads & shoulders above the traditional approach.



[Another article](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/joe_ocampo/archive/2007/09/20/agile-vs-traditional-development-cost-models-maybe.aspx) I read recently compares the cost models of Agile and Traditional project development. What really gets my attention is the profit generated by the value stream of a mature agile development. Now that is something to sell a client on!



By the way, in that cost model article, it's worth reading the comments at the end, especially following up on the ["Broken Iron Triangle" Software Development Anti-pattern](http://www.ambysoft.com/essays/brokenTriangle.html).
