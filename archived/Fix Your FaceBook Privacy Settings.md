## Fix Your FaceBook Privacy Settings


[![image](images/2010/WLW-FixYourFacebookPrivacySettings_9373-image_thumb.png)](images/2010/WLW-FixYourFacebookPrivacySettings_9373-image_2.png) A free tool from [ReclaimPrivacy.org](http://www.ReclaimPrivacy.org) allows you easily check – and fix! – your privacy settings on [FaceBook](http://www.FaceBook.com).



Why is that important? First, many people find it difficult to find (let alone change) their privacy settings on [FaceBook](http://www.FaceBook.com). Not only are they difficult to find, [FaceBook](http://www.FaceBook.com) sometimes changes what those settings are (and what their *default* settings are) and how they work.



Secondly, [FaceBook](http://www.FaceBook.com) is a website that allows you to integrate third-party applications (like FarmTown) into your account on [FaceBook](http://www.FaceBook.com). These third-party programs often ask for (and can expose) your personal information.



If you're interested in keeping your privacy on [FaceBook](http://www.FaceBook.com), then check it out – [www.ReclaimPrivacy.org](http://www.ReclaimPrivacy.org). You can see a demo of how to use this free tool below.

(It's a rough video demo, whose quality was degraded in the upload to YouTube – I'll look at fixing it a bit later.)



I first heard about it at [CNN Online](http://www.cnn.com/video/data/2.0/video/bestoftv/2010/05/18/mxp.westhoven.reclaim.privacy.cnn.html).
