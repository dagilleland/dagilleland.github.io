## Stuff I Gotta Try


I bump into a lot of great programming ideas/technologies/tools/techniques/concepts/etc. I often think to myself, "I gotta try that" or "I need to remember where this is." So I don't forget these things, I often keep browser windows open. But, I'm running out of memory, so I need to blog it to remember it. So, here's a list of the keepers for today.


## AJAX

- [24 Best Practices of AJAX Implementations](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/24-best-practices-for-ajax-implementations/) – The name says it all!
- [4 Steps to Consume Web Services Using Ajax](http://www.dotnetfunda.com/articles/article794-4-steps-to-consume-web-services-using-ajax-includes-video-tutorial-.aspx) - (Includes Video Tutorial) Again, the name says it all. Plus, I can see a numbers theme starting here…


## Windows Home Server


Among other things, I'm looking into getting a real Home Server & do a more formal (& organized) backup of stuff I've got. Right now, backups are rather disorganized, and with the crash of an external HD at work, I'm feeling a bit skittish on my own system. So, I've been glancing at Windows Home Server (WHS) again, and I've seen some good deals at Memory Express, like the [Acer H340](http://www.memoryexpress.com/Products/PID-MX23988(ME).aspx) (or the other [Acer H340](http://www.memoryexpress.com/Products/PID-MX27056(ME).aspx)).

- [WHS Canada Home Page](http://www.microsoft.com/canada/windows/products/winfamily/windowshomeserver/default.mspx?CM=Nav&amp;CE=Nav2b)
- [Vail Beta Announcement](http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/LarryLarsen/Windows-Home-Server-Vail/Default.aspx?wa=wsignin1.0#Page=1) (video)

- Add-Ins

 - [WHS Outlook](http://www.theofficemaven.com/products/whs-outlook)

- Setting Up

That's all for now.
