## Five Tips to Maximizing Your Website


Here's a few quick tips for getting the most our of your website. Of course, they all involve some planning, but most profitable ventures do...*(Re-posted from a previous site of mine, from Sunday, September 03, 2006)*


## Know (and target) Your Audience


This means a few things: First, the content of your site must be of interest to whoever your market group is. If you are a non-profit organization, it should address the interests of your existing (and potential) members. If you are a business, it should communicate the products and services you have to offer.



Second,


## Get the Word Out


Don't expect the search engines to do all the footwork of driving people to your website. You are going to have to find ways to tell people (a) where to find you and (b) why they should take the time to look for you.



***Ranking*** is a term that refers to how high up your site will appear when listed on a given search engine like Google or Yahoo. There are numerous Internet companies who advertise that they can improve your website's rankings in the popular search engines (like Google, Yahoo and MSN). A big problem with using them, however, is cost. I have known people who spend upwards of $250 per month in an attempt to improve their search rankings. That can add up to well over $6000 a year, with no real guarantee that the results will last more than a short while (particularly as these search engines change their ranking algorithms).



That means advertising your website address on your business cards, store receipts, and letterhead. If you do newspaper or flier ads, include your website address. Ask your customers, when they go through your till, "Have you visited our website?" Let them know if you advertise regular specials or if you put printable coupons on your site (and have a few "spare" ones at the till to apply to the customers current purchase, if they haven't gotten to your site yet). Remember, if you are hoping for your website to drive people to your business, then you need to find ways to let them know about your website.


## Keep it Current


This is, by far, one of the more difficult – and necessary – tasks. Many websites are "dead." What you do with your site's content should consume as much time as the planning you put into newspaper or flyer ads and the arrangement of products in your store window. Think "curbside appeal" - that's what helps to sell houses; no-one wants to buy a house that look run down or has old paint or shingles.



The best way to keep you site current is to edit the content, perhaps by posting online "coupons" (if you're a business), or writing up short articles, tips, or other items of interest. Keeping your website current, however, doesn't mean you have to do all, or even most, of the writing. If you can leverage news feeds or RSS articles that are relevant to your site's visitors (and related to your site's content), then having these on a front page can make it "look" like something's new on your site.


## Don't go Overboard


Rember the focus of your business or non-profit organization. Your website is only a tool meant to enhance what your real-world, day-time work is all about. Don't try to make your organization revolve around the website - remember your core products and services, and make your website work for you.



People sometimes wonder if they should sell their products or services on-line. Very few businesses have, need, or can support an on-line store (though it's becoming more and more affordable to do so). Remember that if you plan on selling services or products online, you had better be ready to give on-line support as well, whether that be through your website directly or via e-mail. People who shop on-line expect support on-line. Before you decide to go this route, ask yourself if you are ready to do the work that's involved, or if you should just focus on your regular channels of doing business. What that means is, for the short-term at least, your website is probably better off by focusing on encouraging people to visit your brick-and-mortar store.


## Get a Marathon Mindset


Don't expect your website to be a one-time project that will serve you forever. Come up with some kind of maintenance plan for your site. Over time, your website should evolve with your business or organization. Make some kind of schedule where you reguarly re-visit your site to examine its function, content and design. That should be at least twice a year. And, while you're at it, set aside money to make it happen. Often, if something is written into the budget, it's more likely to be done. If you view your website as an on-going concern, it will have the chance to grow with you. Remember, a marathon mindset is a must!


## Conclusion


There are other tips you can apply, but the ones identified here are among the most important. Of course, the more you plan, the better your execution is likely to be. And the better your execution, the more likely you will be able to plan and take advantage of further opportunities. Your first website plan doesn't have to be big, but if you keep these tips in mind you will be able to grow it over time.
