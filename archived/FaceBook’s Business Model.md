## FaceBook's Business Model


> *An interesting*[*article*](http://ghanabusinessnews.com/2009/07/23/will-facebook-survive-another-five-years-after-250-million-members/)*is written by Kurt Soller (original source: Newsweek). Here's my thoughts (which I posted in comments to that article as well).*



Another factor to consider is demographics. Although this is alluded to in the article, it should be examined in its own right.



Here's what I'm observing: It appears to me that [FaceBook](http://www.FaceBook.com)'s early appeal has been to young people. But older people are finding it to be a quick/easy way to keep in touch, and are signing up in increasing numbers (at rates, I suspect, that are higher then what's happening with the "under-30″ crowd right now). Then they "friend" their kids (as mentioned in the article) – this is the "uncool-ness" factor; imagine a college party or event that your parents show up at.



Like I said, this has been alluded to in the article, but what should be examined in the aftermath of people abandoning, disabling or deleting their accounts is this: Are there demographics to who's leaving [FaceBook](http://www.FaceBook.com)? Maybe [FaceBook](http://www.FaceBook.com)'s evolution will be to grab the older people who are starting to get around to getting on the ‘net. Perhaps there are clues here that could lead to a profitable business model.
