## Reviewing Drafts in Ventrian's News Articles Module


Whether you are interested in personal blogging or having a small online newspaper, you should definitely try out Ventrian's News Articles Module.

 

One of the great features of this DotNetNukeÂ® module is its support of a publishing workflow. Authors can create drafts of articles and can submit articles for publishing. Editors can review submitted articles as well as drafts and then approve them as published works. In this article, I will walk through the steps that an Editor can take in reviewing draft or submitted articles.


* * *
 To begin, the Editor would sign onto the website and navigate to the page with the News Articles module. From there, clicking on the "My Articles" link will bring up a page where a list of published, draft and submitted articles can be viewed.

Editors get an extra item that ordinary authors don't see when viewing this page: a check-box to show all articles form all authors. All the Editor needs to do is select the check-box and choose whether to view submissions, drafts or published articles, and a list of those articles will be shown below.

 

Clicking on the article's title will open that article so that it can previewed. Clicking on the pencil icon () will open the page in edit mode.

 

When listing unapproved articles, there is at the right of the article a check-box for approving the article. All the Editor needs to do is select the articles she wished to approve and click the "Approve Selected Articles" link. Alternatively, the Editor can click the "Approve All Articles" link.
