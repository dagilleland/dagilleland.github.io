# Dan's Blog

This is Dan Gilleland's blog site hosted as a GitHub User Page. I have a few repositories and gists posted on GitHub. Checking out my profile is the best way to get an idea of what I've got posted here.

## About Dan Gilleland

I'm a full-time programming instructor at NAIT in the Digital Media and IT program (see my staff website) and I run a small business called Dynamic Generation Inc. I've worked full-time in Information Technology (mostly teaching) since the late 1990s. My own interests in computers, however, goes way back to the late '70s, when I first began learning how to program in high school.

~~There's more to learn about me, both on this website and on my other sites. If you want to read some of my articles/musings/blogs, then head over to http://kb.Gilleland.ca or kb.Gilleland.info(the "kb" stand for "knowledge base").~~
