Welcome to My GitHub Pages.

This is Dan's GitHub User Page. I have a few repositories and gists posted on GitHub. Checking out my profile is the best way to get an idea of what I've got posted here.

About Dan Gilleland

I'm a full-time programming instructor at NAIT in the Digital Media and IT program (see my staff website) and I run a small business called Dynamic Generation Inc. I've worked full-time in Information Technology (mostly teaching) since the late 1990s. My own interests in computers, however, goes way back to the late '70s, when I first began learning how to program in high school.

There's more to learn about me, both on this website and on my other sites. If you want to read some of my articles/musings/blogs, then head over to http://kb.Gilleland.ca or kb.Gilleland.info(the "kb" stand for "knowledge base").
